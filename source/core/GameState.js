/*
* LOGIN - Partly created a login system to force document interaction, but also to save user information / beta testing.
* HOME - Is the user on the home screen?
* PLAY - Is the main game active?
* END - I added this in case we ever have a use, but since this is fully intended to be
* infinitely generated, I doubt it will ever be used.
